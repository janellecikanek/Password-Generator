# Password-Generator

## Description

For those with access to sensitive data, I want to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria. Creating a stronger password will provide greater security. Employees will be able to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

Creating this password genrator helped me have a better understanding of Java Script and logic.
